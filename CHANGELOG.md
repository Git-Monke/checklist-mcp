## [June 23, 2025] - MCP Server Modular Architecture Refactoring

### Enhanced

- **Major MCP Server Architecture Overhaul**

  - **Modular Tool System**: Extracted all 9 tools from monolithic server into individual modules using factory pattern
    - **Individual Tool Files**: Each tool now has its own file in `src/tools/` directory
    - **Factory Pattern Implementation**: Tools use `createXxxTool(dependencies)` functions for proper dependency injection
    - **Consistent Structure**: All tools return `{ name, definition, handler }` objects for uniform registration
    - **Independent Testing**: Each tool can be tested in isolation with mocked dependencies
  - **Dependency Injection Architecture**: Tools receive only the functions they need (dbRequest, formatItems, flattenItems)
  - **Utility Function Extraction**: Moved shared functions to centralized tools module
    - **`formatItems`**: Hierarchical list formatting utility extracted from get_list tool
    - **`flattenItems`**: Item search flattening utility extracted from find_list_item tool
  - **Configuration Module**: Centralized all environment variables and constants in `src/config.js`
    - Environment variables (DB_SERVER_URL, WEB_SERVER_URL)
    - MCP server configuration object
    - Database request defaults and HTTP status codes
    - Format constants and validation limits
  - **Dependency Management Module**: Extracted auto-startup functionality into `src/dependency-manager.js`
    - Smart service detection and automatic startup
    - Process management and graceful cleanup
    - Health monitoring and error handling
  - **Significant Code Reduction**: Main server file reduced from ~918 lines to ~300 lines (68% reduction)
  - **ES Module Architecture**: All modules use proper `export function` syntax for better tree-shaking

- **Tool Modularization Completed**
  - **`get_all_lists`**: Simple list retrieval with error handling
  - **`get_list`**: Detailed list with hierarchical item formatting using formatItems utility
  - **`create_list`**: List creation with validation and error responses
  - **`add_list_item`**: Single item addition with nesting support and parent validation
  - **`bulk_add_list_items`**: Complex bulk operations with error aggregation and rollback handling
  - **`find_list_item`**: Text search using flattenItems utility with regex matching
  - **`update_list_item`**: Item modification with text and completion status updates
  - **`delete_list_item`**: Item deletion with proper cascade handling

### Added

- **Comprehensive Testing Protocol**: Live functionality testing during refactoring
  - Created "Example list ðŸŽ‰" for real MCP environment validation
  - Tested all tools with emojis, completion status changes, and bulk operations
  - Verified import/export syntax and tool registration throughout migration
  - Confirmed WebSocket integration and real-time updates maintained
- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles specific functionality
  - Tools directory for all MCP tool implementations
  - Configuration management for environment settings
  - Dependency management for service orchestration
  - Utility functions for shared business logic

### Technical Debt Resolved

- **Monolithic File Structure**: Broke down 900+ line server file into focused modules
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: Separated tool logic, configuration, dependencies, and utilities
- **Import Management**: Clean ES module structure with proper dependency injection
- **Testing Complexity**: Individual tools can now be unit tested independently
- **Code Duplication**: Shared utilities extracted and reused across tools

## [June 23, 2025] - Component Refactoring & Auto-Dependency Management

### Enhanced

- **Auto-Dependency Startup for MCP Server**

  - **Smart Dependency Detection**: MCP server now automatically detects if database and web servers are running on startup
  - **Automatic Service Startup**: If dependencies aren't running, MCP server will automatically start them before initializing itself
  - **Health Checks**: Performs proper health checks to ensure services are ready before proceeding
  - **Graceful Cleanup**: Properly manages child processes and cleans up started services on shutdown
  - **Improved User Experience**: Users can now start just the MCP server and have the entire stack automatically available
  - **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging throughout the dependency startup process

- **Major Component Architecture Refactoring**
  - **Modular Component Extraction**: Broke down monolithic `ListItemsTree` into focused, single-responsibility components
    - **`ListItemNode`**: Core item display, state management, and user interactions (checkbox, editing, hover states)
    - **`ListItemActions`**: Dedicated component for all action buttons (Add, Copy, Delete, Expand/Collapse) with proper hover states and event handling
    - **`ListItemChildren`**: Handles animated rendering of nested items with Framer Motion expand/collapse transitions
    - **`InlineEditText`**: Reusable text editing component with save/cancel functionality and visual feedback
    - **`AddItemInput`**: Item creation component supporting both parent and child item addition
  - **Improved Code Organization**: Each component now has clear boundaries and responsibilities
  - **Enhanced Maintainability**: Easier testing, debugging, and feature additions with smaller, focused components
  - **Better TypeScript Integration**: Proper interfaces and type safety across all extracted components
  - **Reduced Component Complexity**: Main `ListItemNode` reduced from ~160 lines to ~110 lines with much cleaner logic
- **User Experience Improvements**
  - **Fixed Critical Infinite Loop Bug**: Resolved `useEffect` dependency issue in `App.tsx` that was causing browser freezes
  - **Smooth Component Interactions**: All existing animations and hover states preserved during refactoring
  - **Consistent State Management**: Proper prop passing and callback handling between extracted components

### Added

## [Previous Updates] - Sun Jun 22

### Added

- Initial SQLite database setup with migration support and schema for lists and list items.
- Express.js API with full CRUD endpoints for lists and list items, including:
  - `/lists` and `/lists/:id`

- CORS support for cross-origin requests from the frontend.
- WebSocket server for real-time update notifications (`lists_updated` broadcast on changes).

- `buildListItemTree` utility to return list items as a tree structure, now including `parent_id` in each item.

### Changed

- Refactored API to always return list items as a tree under each list.
- Improved error handling and status codes for all endpoints.

- Modularized frontend components for sidebar, list tree, and editing.

### Fixed

- Ensured all list item CRUD operations update the frontend state and reflect changes immediately.
